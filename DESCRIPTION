Title: GAM and linear stratified observational and MR estimates of exposure on outcome.
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David A Hughes
Maintainer: The package maintainer <d.a.hughes@bristol.ac.uk>
Description: A pacakge to derive observational & causal estimates, in a Mendelian Randomization framework,
    for exposure on outcome relationships that may be non-linear. The package will fit both a linear and a
    generalized additive model (GAM) to the data, and will stratify your exposure to derive linear estimates
    for each strata. Non-linearity can be evaluated by testing the GAM to the linear model over the entire 
    data or by evaluating heterogenity in the strata point estimates.
